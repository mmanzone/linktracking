                    <h3>Managing Links</h3>
                    <p>Your LinkReach page serves as a library for all your important online resources. Not all links in your library are always displayed on your public landing page; their display can be customized by date using Campaigns.</p>
                    <p>To add a new link to your library:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Navigate to the 'Links' section in your dashboard.</li>
                        <li>Click 'Add New Link'.</li>
                        <li>Enter the URL and a descriptive title for your link.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>From the 'Links' management area, you can also:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Disable Links:</strong> Temporarily hide a link from your public landing page without deleting it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reorder Links:</strong> Change the order in which links appear on your public landing page by moving them up or down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edit/Delete:</strong> Modify the URL or title of an existing link, or remove it entirely from your library.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="help-section">
                    <h3>Campaigns Management</h3>
                    <p>Campaigns allow you to control which links are active and displayed on your landing page during specific timeframes, perfect for events, promotions, or seasonal content.</p>
                    <p>To create or manage a campaign:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Navigate to the 'Campaigns' section in your dashboard.</li>

                        <li>Campaigns can be activated or deactivated as needed, allowing you to easily switch between different sets of links.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Only links associated with an active campaign and falling within its date range will be displayed on your public landing page.</p>

                    <p>At LinkReach, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about the data we collect. This section outlines what information is collected and how it is used within the application.</p>
                    <h4>Information We Collect:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> We collect your username (email address), first name, and last name when you create an account or are invited to a tenant.

                        <li><strong>Link Data and Visit Statistics:</strong> We collect data related to the links you create, including their URLs and titles.

This includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, geographical location data, or any other details that could identify a specific individual browsing your links. Our analytics are designed to be privacy-friendly, focusing on aggregated engagement metrics rather than individual visitor tracking.</p>
