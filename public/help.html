                    <p>At LinkReach, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about the data we collect. This section outlines what information is collected and how it is used within the application.</p>
                    <h4>Information We Collect:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> We collect your username (email address), first name, and last name when you create an account or are invited to a tenant. This information is used solely for authentication, account management, and to personalize your experience within LinkReach.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tenant Organization Name:</strong> We collect the name of your tenant organization to properly manage your dedicated landing page and associate it with your user account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Link Data and Visit Statistics:</strong> We collect data related to the links you create, including their URLs and titles. We also track anonymized visit statistics for your LinkReach landing page and clicks on the links you share. This data includes the timestamp of the visit/click, the specific link ID clicked, and the user agent (browser/device information). This information is aggregated to provide you with insights into your page's performance and is not used to identify individual visitors.</li>

This includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, geographical location data, or any other details that could identify a specific individual browsing your links. Our analytics are designed to be privacy-friendly, focusing on aggregated engagement metrics rather than individual visitor tracking.</p>
                    <h4>Data Usage:</h4>
                    <p>The collected information is used to:</p>
