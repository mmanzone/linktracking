                    <h3>⚙️ How LinkReach Works</h3>
                    <p>LinkReach provides each organisation with a unique, customisable page that serves as a central hub for all essential links. Once you register, administrators on your team can easily log in to the intuitive dashboard. Here, you can upload your logo, select theme colours to match your branding, and quickly add or edit the links you want to share. This page is instantly accessible via a shortened URL, which we recommend turning into a dynamic QR code for maximum offline accessibility. Every single visit to your page and every click on a link is automatically logged in your dedicated analytics module. This provides comprehensive, easy-to-read reports that help you measure the real-world impact of your efforts, ensuring you can efficiently allocate resources and refine your communication strategy.</p>
