# What's the purpose?

Organisations want to engage with communities or customers during events, conference, outreach but don't have use printed resources anymore ($$ and reducing paper/waste). There are QR-code solutions allowing visitors to get more info, but they often do not include any way to track impact. There are a few freemium solutions out there but the features are limited or change with time

# What's the solution?

A simple customised landing page with a list of link routing to commEng resources. All visit to the page and click on links are tracked, allowing to measure impact.

The interface is fully customisabale and allow:
* to add/edit/create and hide/show links on the landing page
* customise the theme, colours, logo...etc.. to match the branding
* drill into analytics per day, campaign or time of day when people engaged wit the tool
* create campaign allowing personalisation of the landing page for a specific event. For example during world tsunami days, resources about Tsunami might be moved higher in the list, and some other items might be removed. Running a Fundraising event? Add a donation ink at the very top! Each campaign can have its own set of logos and a customisable message

# Want to give it a try? 

Click on the Admin link at the bottom of the page 
The system is in dev at the moment, feel free to edit anything, change logo, add links, create/edit campaigns and see the results in the Analytics module. It should be pretty self-explanatory (I hope)

# What's coming next?

* Multi-tenancy, ie. having multiple accounts (eg multiple organisations) using the same platform but having their own set of links and customisation. This will include a proper authentication mechanism
* Trackable direct link, to allow the creation of a link to a specific resource bypassing the landing page  (eg. a specific event poster) via a QR code but still being tracked
Lead management: ability to collect information eg names, email for people expressing interest
* Payment gateway integration: ability to take a donation with a direct link to Square or other platforms
